Things I found out:
	In CSS, putting border-box on position relative elements doesn't affect their 'size' when compared to position absolute elements within or below the original to calculate distance. For example, adding border-top (with border-box and position relative) to a nav will affect the element below (with position absolute) and how many pixels of 'top' are needed to move that element down. I believe this is because

	The above principle will also affect the line-height

	Psuedo elements inherit overflow hidden from parent, even if you try to overwrite it

	CSS filter blur doesnt work with animation of leftss

Post Ideas
	Explain the 'Group Blog' setup for Jekyll and Github Pages
		- Remember to restart Jekyll when you make changes to _config.yml
		- Capture variable names can't be dash seperated.
		- CSS templating

	Explain DaisywheelJS

	Explain Marketing technique or DaisywheelJS

	Explain Navigation.css input focus technique

	Tips for doing complex dom stuff
		- psuedo-elements cant be directly modified in javascript
			a. Inject a style tag with the specific styles for the :before/:after elements

	Advantages to using CSS and DOM versus canvas rendering (CSS Visualizers)
		- Crisper rendering
		- Easier scaling
		- Easily inspect element's values
		- Animations/Transitions calculated on the GPU
		- Web Animation
		- Support is as varied as you want


TODO:
	Only request the icons needed from font-awesome (uparrow, rss, email, github, twitter)

	Make sure that if authors dont include something then the div/styles dont show up.
	Make navigation repo and remove transition styles.
	Google Doc of all the text on the site
	Make sure templates work with title and alt tags.
	Add titles and alt text to everything
