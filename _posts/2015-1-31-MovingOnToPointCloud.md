title: Moving on to Point Cloud example
---

So I'm moving on to the Point Cloud Example.

  * Cloned the MotionTracking repository
  * Swapped out the MainREnderer for the PC Renderer that ships with the PointCloud example.  So far, no need to alter the renderer beyond the interface methods for the translation and rotation of the camera
  
After some hacking away on some specific point cloud settings, I have the original demo running in VR.

To do:

  - Get translucency going!!
