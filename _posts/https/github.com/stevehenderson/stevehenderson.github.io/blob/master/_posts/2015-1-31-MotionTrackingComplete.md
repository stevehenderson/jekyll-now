OK..today I made some good headway on the Motion Tracking example.

I finished the OpenGL 2.0 renderer.  I committed all changes and pushed the code.  I also renamed the repository to make it more self-explanatory.

TODO:

  - Calibration.  Right now the camera is not calibrated with the display
  - IMU Calibration.  The IMU is not calibrated with the camera either
  
..but I'm moving on to PointCloud example to see if I can get the video working with points/depth
