title: Coding Every Day
---

I want to get back to the point were I am coding and developing every day.  As a program director, I had less time for technical research as I was focused more on curriculum development and the day to day slog.  As I transition, I want to recapture that daily passion for tinkering.

I've been inspired by some other people who have made a vow to code everyday:

[John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) was my biggest inspiration!
[Jennifer Dewalt](http://jenniferdewalt.com) coded 180 websites in 180 days!

Like John, my rules are:

* I must write code every day
* It has to be useful code
* All code must be completed before 2300h
* As much as possible, it should be open and posted on github

Initially, my drivers will be:

* Coursera class assignments (need to think about keeping these open)
* Python tutorials -- learn python by completeing challenges
* Research projects
