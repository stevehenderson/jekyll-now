title: Coursera Assignment 2 Turn-in
---

One of the motivators I'm using to help stay in the coding game is Coursera.

To date, I've completed several courses 

[Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/N2QJVPWUCT)
[Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/MG4DZPTP72)
[Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/UUKEJJ8WMP)
[Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/QER75DC2F9)
[Computational Investing](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WNCTZY79YW)

I'm currently enrolled in:  [Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Communication](https://www.coursera.org/course/posacommunication)

Just completed the second assignment.

I don't post this code on my github, as I don't want to interefere with the instructor's courses and give away the answers (not that my answers are any good!)

So this activity isn't logged in my github activity log...but this blog is (I think)
