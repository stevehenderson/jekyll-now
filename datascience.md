# Data Sources

## Cyber

### Aggregate-level Cyber Attack Data

[Targeted Cyberattacks logbook](https://apt.securelist.com/#firstPage)

[OWASP/WASC Web Hacking Incident Database (WHD)](​https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S283929Jw2s)

### Low-Level Data (PCAP, etc)

[Cyber Security Data Mining Competition (CDMC)](http://www.csmining.org/ )

The 2015 CDMC at ICONP is a challenging, multi-month research and practice competition, focusing on application of knowledge discovery techniques to solve advanced, real-world problems. The competition is open to multi-person teams worldwide. Contestants are invited to participate in solving a set of problems in fields of cybersecurity, text mining, image processing, etc.

[KDD CUP 99](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html Homepage​)

An early baseline for IDS:

This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.

See: Stolfo, J., et al. "Cost-based modeling and evaluation for data mining with application to fraud and intrusion detection." Results from the JAM Project by Salvatore (2000).

[NSL-KDD](http://www.ijarcce.com/upload/2015/june-15/IJARCCE%2096.pdf)

Some sort of IDS data set.

Replaced an erlier version KDD CUP 99 (see above)

​[Predict](https://www.predict.org/)

Welcome to PREDICT, the Protected Repository for the Defense of Infrastructure Against Cyber Threats. PREDICT can quickly and easily provide qualified developers and evaluators with regularly updated network operations data they can use in their cyber security research.

PREDICT is supported by the Department of Homeland Security, Science & Technology Directorate.

Our distributed repository of data hosts and providers located at major universities and other venues helps researchers generate repeatable results and save time and financial resources by not having to invest in data collection and storage capacities.

## Media

GDELT project

(http://gdeltproject.org/data.html)

The GDELT Project is the largest, most comprehensive, and highest resolution open database of human society ever created. Its Event Database archives contain nearly 400M latitude/longitude geographic coordinates spanning over 12,900 days, additionally making it one of the largest open-access spatio-temporal datasets in existance. It truly pushes the boundaries of "big data," weighing in at over a quarter-billion rows with 59 fields for each record, spanning the geography of the entire planet, and covering a time horizon of more than 35 years. Its Global Knowledge Graph connects the world's people, organizations, locations, themes, counts, and emotions into a single holistic network over the entire planet. How can you query, explore, model, visualize, interact, and even forecast this vast archive of human society?
